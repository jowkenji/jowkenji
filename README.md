👋 Hi! my name is Jhonny Kenji Goya. I’m an electrical engineer interested in technology, design, woodworking, sports, philosophy...

🌱 I learned algoritms and C in college, but I've never really focused on it. Things got serious after I took basic Pyhton course online last year. Now I’m currently following Mozilla's program to become a front-end web developer.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that could help people change the world.
