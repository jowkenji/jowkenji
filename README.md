ðŸ‘‹ Hi! my name is Jhonny Kenji Goya. Iâ€™m an electrical engineer interested in technology, design, woodworking, sports, philosophy...

ðŸŒ± I learned algoritms and C in college, but I've never really focused on it. Things got serious after I took basic Pyhton course online last year. Now Iâ€™m currently following Mozilla's program to become a front-end web developer.

Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity to start my dev career. If you like my projects, let's work together! ðŸ“§ jj_kenji@hotmail.com
